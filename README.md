# RChain Developer Guide
A guide to developing in RhoLang on the RChain blockchain and an experiment in compensated cooperative licensing.

## Compensated Cooperative License
This work is open source in that its source is available and collaboration is welcome however it's not meant to be created without compensation. You can read about the license for this work within this guide.

## Rholang
Rholang is a fantastically intreguing programming language. It is based in a very simple model of computation but one that is very different from the Von Neumann architecture in use since the 1940's.

Rholang programs can be thought to define both the client and the server components of today's web application design. Or, one could think of Rholang as a language for peer to peer applications at a global scale.


The Rholang language emerged from the  Rho Calculus by Greg Meredith and Michael Stay.
