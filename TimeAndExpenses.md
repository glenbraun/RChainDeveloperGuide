# Time and Expenses
The creators of the project expect to be compensated for their work. This file captures the creator's expectations for compensation. Meeting these expectations meets the terms of the license defined in the LICENSE file of this project.

## Column Definitions
### Date
The date the work was done or checked in. 

### Time or Expense
A quantity of contribution. Best described by examples. 

* Time - To record the time working on a task specify it in hours or days. Include time that you actively worked on the task. It can include some time that was spent bouncing off shortly to other tasks but, in general, should be limited to time primarily focused on the work described in the statement of work. There are natural limits here. In the future one could imagine being able to track a person's work across all projects they collaborate. It would be a challenge to justify more than 24 hours a day of work, or that one worked 24 hours a day for an extended period of time. Well, maybe an oncall type task might fit this definition.
* Expense - Used to record a specific expense related to the project.
* Indeterminant - How does one capture the time it took to come up with an idea? Yet, expressing only the time it took to share the idea captures none of the actual effort. Use indeterminant to specify this type of contribution.

### Statement of Work
A statement of the contribution.

### Identity
Some mechanism of indicating who did the work and where compensation should be sent. To start, an Ethereum wallet address.

### Compensation
The indication of the compensation that has been sent to the creator. It need not be a specific value. Though if the identity is an address one could obtain this information from the Ethereum history.

### Attitude
This is how the creator feels about the level of compensation. 

### Jackpot
This is a statement by the creator of a maximum compensation expectation. It does not have to be a specific value.
